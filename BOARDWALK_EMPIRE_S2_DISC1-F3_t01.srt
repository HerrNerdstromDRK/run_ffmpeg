1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,260
Good morning, ma'am.

2
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,260
Good morning, Katie.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Pauline?

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Lillian?

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Ma'am.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Mrs. Schroeder.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Are the children up?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Just breakfasting now.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That is today's press.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Surely it either is or it isn't.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
She's going to find out anyway.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I've been crying for hours.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Not up here.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Here's a look.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But I have stayed for words.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Probably 2.
